# lovely-wedding-store

A wedding-related ecommerce website that deals with wedding products. The website should be designed with a romantic and elegant theme, incorporating soft colors and sophisticated fonts to reflect the beauty and significance of weddings. The homepage should feature a gallery of product categories such as wedding dresses, suits, wedding rings, decorations, and invitations. Each category should lead to a detailed page with product listings, including images, descriptions, and prices. The website should also include a shopping cart, checkout process, and user account management for a seamless shopping experience. An about us page that tells the story of the brand and a contact page for customer inquiries are also essential.
